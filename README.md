# Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion Models

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2311.16090-red)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16090)

## TL;DR: The Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) Framework features:
1. **Self-correction**: Enhances generative models with LLM-integrated detectors for precise text-to-image alignment.
2. **Unified Generation and Editing**: Excels at both image generation and fine-grained editing.
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with ANY image generator, like DALL-E 3, requiring no extra training or data.
